## Overview
This is a web app that lets users view and leave comments on the latest news. The latest articles are display by using Mongoose and Cheerio to scrape them from the New York Times website.

### Technical specifications
This application demonstrates a full stack application using the MVC model (Model–View–Controller). HTML/CSS and Handlebars were used for the front end of the application - Handlebars handles the HTML templating. The backend of the application was implemented with Node, Express, & a homemade ORM.
Once a user clicks on the Scrape New Articles button, they are inserted into the mongoDB database with a saved status of False (i.e. 0). Once the Save Article button is submitted then the saved status is updated to True (i.e. 1) and the article shows up on the saved articles page.
